# Contributing Guidelines

* The intent of this project is to gather **AWESOME** Starter Kits created for **Laravel**.
* Don't open a Draft / WIP Pull Request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
* The submitted Starter Kit MUST have test cases for provided features and documentation, at least having the basics on the README file.
* The submitted Starter Kit MUST have its latest version supporting the latest release of the **Laravel** Framework.
* Add ONE Starter Kit per Pull Request.
* Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category, if you're submitting what you think it's a new category, add the category in the PR for discussion, add the category in ASC order by its name.
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
* Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
* Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
